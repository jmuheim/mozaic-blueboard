// To route Sysex communication, the first two params of SendSysex are always the following:
//
// - Instance ID: ID of the Mozaic instance which should receive the data.
// - Action ID: ID of the action which should be called inside the respective Mozaic instance.
//
// We use the following table for reference, to make sure that no collisions happen (i.e. accidentally assigning the same value to different IDs).
//
// Whenever introducing a new ID, please consult this table!
